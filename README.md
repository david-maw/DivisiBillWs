# DivisiBillWs

DivisiBill is a free .NET MAUI project with only an Android build at present. It is available in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autoplus.divisibill). DivisiBill is currently
the only product of [AutoPlus](http://autopl.us) and there's more information on the web site [here](https://www.autopl.us/divisibill/index.html) .

This web service (implemented as Azure functions) provides cloud based services (licensing, storage and OCR at present) to the DivisiBill app. The web service isn't mandatory, but it does add value.
